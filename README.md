# Classify Song Genres from Audio Data
Rock or rap? Apply machine learning methods in Python to classify songs into genres.
### Project Description
Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock), to train a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify). Making use of pandas and seaborn packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors should be considered when doing machine learning.

Next, the use of the scikit-learn package to predict the genre of a song based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc. \
Algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression and decision trees were implemented in this project.
